Whoooooo rememberrrrsss about Scholasticcc Home Baseeee???? That fun mmo game where you could make comics and
talk to your favorite scholastic characters... and even have fun with other fans of the game? I know I remember.
in fact, this mhtml is an archival of the home base main page before it has become what it is... rip home base 2019-2025 
okay but like i have a buttload of content remaining. i scraped EVERYTHING i could, and i have:
the whole website
windows and mac versions of home base
a bunch of memories to remember.
